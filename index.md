# Kathleen's First CS 193 Homework!

## Some of my favorite things about CS 193: 
- learning about CS opportunities within Purdue
- having a place to practice skills future classes might just assume we know
- run by students who are more approachable than professors
- content is practical and engaging
- low commitment in terms of homework, but high payoff in terms of applicable skills
- easy way to make more friends in CS
- PSOs are offered but optional
### I hope y'all are having a wonderful day! :D
